Computer Engineering & Trading.

This repository contains my ongoing work and experiments, mainly focused on computer engineering fundamentals, system design, and hands-on prototyping.  
Most projects are built iteratively, starting from simulation and analysis.

## Notes

Some older repositories related to blockchain, web, or software development reflect areas I explored earlier and remain part of my technical background.
